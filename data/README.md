# 📂 Data Directory

This folder contains the datasets for the Airbnb Data Cleaning project.

## 🌐 Data Source
The raw data (`listings.csv`) is sourced from **Inside Airbnb**, an independent, non-commercial project that provides data about Airbnb's impact on residential communities.
* **Source:** [Inside Airbnb - Get the Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
